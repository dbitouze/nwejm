nwejm - Support for the journal "North-Western European Journal of Mathematics"
===============================================================================

The `nwejm` bundle provides LaTeX classes for the journal "North-Western
European Journal of Mathematics.

Installation
------------

The classes are supplied in `.dtx` format.  If you want to unpack the `.dtx`
yourself, running `tex nwejm.dtx` will extract the package whereas
`pdflatex nwejm` will typeset the documentation of the `nwejmart` class
(currently only in French).

Typesetting the documentation also requires a number of packages in addition to
those needed to use the `nwejm` classes.  To compile the documentation without
error, you will need, among others, my personal package `denisbdoc` for
documenting the classes I've written.
