# Overview

The purpose of the current LaTeX bundle, `nwejm`, is to provide two classes and
`biblatex styles` for
the (new)
[North-Western European Journal of Mathematics (NWEJM)](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~nwejm/):

- `nwejm` for the complete issues of the journal, aimed for the NWEJM's team,
- `nwejmart`, intended for the authors who wish to publish an article in the
  NWEJM. This class goal is to:
    - faithfully reproduce the layout of the nwejm, thus enabling the authors to
      be able to work their document in actual conditions,
    - provide a number of tools (commands and environments) to facilitate the
      drafting of documents, in particular those containing mathematical formulas.
